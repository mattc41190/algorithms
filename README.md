# Algorithms

## What is this?

This is a collection of algorithms and data strcutures written in a highly isolated fashion in a variety of langauges. Each data structure or algorithim will be explained (and when applicible visualized) to the best of my knowledge.

## Why make this?

To provide myself with a clear explanation of algorithms done by me on my own terms.

## How do I use this?

- Choose a language (top level directory) 
- Find the algorithm you are interested in 
- Read the `README` there. Then read the code 
- Execcute the code according to its execution pattern (if different from typical execution pattern will be in readme)
