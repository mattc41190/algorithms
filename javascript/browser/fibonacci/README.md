# JavaScript - Browser - Fibonacci

## What is this?

This is a demonstration of find the Nth number in the Fibbonacci sequence written in JavaScript using 3 distinct approaches.

## Why make this?

Fibbonacci is a standard academic algorithm, it is a famous algorithm, it is an interesting algorithm, it can be a difficult algorithm to grasp. What better candidate for explanation in a algorithms solutions repository?

## How do I use this?

- Read the code
- Run the code in the browser

## Fibonacci

The Fibbonaci sequence is a set an ever increasing numerical values in which every number starting with 1 (essentially) is the sum of the last 2 numbers in the sequence. The seed values are 0 and 1. So as an example:

0 + 1 = 1 ->
1 + 1 = 2 ->
1 + 2 = 3 ->
2 + 3 = 5 ->
3 + 5 = 8 ->
5 + 8 = 13

This sequence goes on and on forever.

A very common interview question regarding Fibonacci is to write a program that find the Nth number of the sequence. There are two primary ways to do this, iteratively and recursively. Each approach has some tradeoffs, and I will be discussing those trade off and which I prefer.
